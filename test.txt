Phase II clinical trials test the safety\r\n      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works\r\n      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being\r\n      studied.\r\n\r\n      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Neratinib as a treatment for\r\n      breast cancer. Fulvestrant has been FDA approved for treatment of metastatic hormone receptor\r\n      positive breast cancer.\r\n\r\n      The purpose of this research study is to determine how well neratinib, by itself or together\r\n      with Fulvestrant, works in treating breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.\r\n      Neratinib is a recently discovered oral drug that may stop breast cancer cells from growing\r\n      abnormally by inhibiting (or blocking) members of a family of proteins that include Human\r\n      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2).\r\n\r\n      Neratinib has been used in other research studies and information from those other research\r\n      studies suggests that neratinib may help to shrink or stabilize HER2-positive breast cancer\r\n      in this research study.\r\n    \n',)}, 'Criteria': "\n        Inclusion Criteria:\r\n\r\n          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed inoperable locally\r\n             advanced or metastatic ER+ breast cancer. To fulfill the requirement for ER+ disease,\r\n             a breast cancer must express, by immunohistochemistry (IHC), ER in ≥10% of cells, on\r\n             the most recent biopsy. If ER quantification is not available, a determination of ER+\r\n             by IHC will suffice. Central confirmation of ER status is not required.\r\n\r\n          -  Participants must have documented HER2+ disease by overexpression and/or gene\r\n             amplification on the most recent biopsy, per current ASCO-CAP (American Society of\r\n             Clinical Oncology - College of American Pathologists) guidelines. Central confirmation\r\n             of HER2 status is not required.\r\n\r\n          -  Participants must have received prior therapy with the following agents in any\r\n             combination, and in setting (i.e., neoadjuvant, adjuvant, metastatic, etc.). These\r\n             therapies do not need to be the most recent line of therapy.\r\n\r\n               -  Trastuzumab\r\n\r\n               -  Pertuzumab\r\n\r\n               -  Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)\r\n\r\n          -  Participants must agree to undergo a research biopsy of a reasonably accessible\r\n             metastatic lesion (chest wall, skin, subcutaneous tissue, lymph nodes, skin, breast,\r\n             bones, lung, and liver metastases). If a reasonably accessible metastatic lesion is\r\n             not available, the patient may go on study provided that archived tissue is available.\r\n             However, if a reasonably accessible site is available for biopsy, the patient must\r\n             agree to biopsy. Any patients not undergoing biopsy must be approved for study\r\n             enrollment by the Overall Principal Investigator at DFCI. Biopsies may be done with\r\n             local anesthesia or intravenous conscious sedation, according to institutional\r\n             guidelines. If a biopsy requires general anesthesia, then it is only allowed if\r\n             acquisition of tissue is clinically indicated, and excess tissue may be collected for\r\n             research purposes. Patients without sites available for biopsy must have available\r\n             tissue [archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks (FFPB), blocks from which\r\n             slides can be created, or fresh frozen tissue from original diagnosis or metastatic\r\n             setting] for correlative studies. Tissue needs to be located and available at the time\r\n             of registration See Section 9.3 for more details.\r\n\r\n          -  Women ≥ 18 years of age.

If a woman is of\r\n             childbearing potential, she must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the\r\n             study, for the duration of study participation, and for one year after completion of\r\n             the study drug.\r\n\r\n          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\r\n\r\n        Exclusion Criteria:\r\n\r\n          -  Participants who have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of\r\n             similar chemical or biologic composition to neratinib or fulvestrant.\r\n\r\n          -  Participants who have known hypersensitivity to any component of loperamide or\r\n             colestipol.\r\n\r\n          -  Participants who have received previous therapy with neratinib.\r\n\r\n          -  Participants who have received anti-cancer therapy (including chemotherapy, biological\r\n             therapy, investigational agents, hormonal therapy, or other anti-cancer therapy) or\r\n             radiotherapy within ≤14 days prior to the planned initiation of investigational\r\n             products, or those who have not recovered to grade ≤1from adverse events due to their\r\n             most recent therapy (excepting alopecia).\r\n\r\n          -  Participants who have had any major surgery ≤28 days prior to the planned initiation\r\n             of study therapy, or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to\r\n             agents/surgery administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\r\n\r\n          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\r\n\r\n          -  Participants with known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require\r\n             therapy to control symptoms. Participants with a history of treated central nervous\r\n             system (CNS) metastases are eligible. Treated brain metastases are defined as those\r\n             without ongoing requirement for corticosteroids, as ascertained by clinical\r\n             examination and/or brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or CT scan) completed\r\n             during screening. Any corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been\r\n             discontinued without the subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥ 7 days prior to\r\n             registration. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy,\r\n             radiosurgery, surgery or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating\r\n             physician.
